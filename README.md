- Live Site URL: [Netlify](https://sudlice-qrcomponent.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Used inline Styles
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first project from Front-End Mentors, I learnt about Responsive Design and using styles including Shadows.

### Continued development

I want to improve this design by working and gaining more knowledge of using box-shadow, how efficiently we can change text depending on various resolutions by not having to add media queries for example of using 'vw'.


### Useful resources

- [CSS TRICKS](https://www.csstricks.com) - This helped me for Using Box Shadow. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

## Acknowledgments

I really want to thank CSS-Tricks, i've learned alot from that website(Flexbox/Grid Layouts etcetra). If they haven't been there it wouldn't have been easy to learn and implement things.
